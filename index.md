Project FiFo is an open-source Cloud Management and Orchestration system for [SmartOS](https://smartos.org) virtualisation environments. The components of FiFo are written entirely in Erlang which gives the suite excellent stability and fault recovery as it continues maturing to a production quality release.

### Current Release "Whirling Whippet" (0.4.5)

## Fifo Releases 
The project has 2 installable versions - **Current** Release and a **Development** release. The development release changes daily and is only recommended for people who are not afraid to tinker under the hood and get their hands dirty. 

## Our Eco-System
We are **community** driven and as such have a open and **friendly** eco-system, we encourage community engagement, contribution and feedback. Please join us and get involved by giving us new feature ideas or helping out with code or Documentation.
