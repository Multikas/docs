Jingles
#######

Jingles is Project FiFo's graphical user interface. Jingles intereacts with FiFo data using the Wiggle API and recives live updates from Howl. Jingles is a 100% client side web application that can be used as is, or can be modifed and rebranded for your particular cloud needs. Using Jingles a user can create and edit users, networks, packages, datasets, and (of course) virtual machines; all through a easy to use browser interface.
