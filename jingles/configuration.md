# Jingles Configuration
The Jinlges configuration file is stored in `/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js` it's a JSON file with configuration values. It is copied during the first installation and does not get overwritten, however the newest configuration can always be found under `/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js.example`

The remote dataset, the warnings generated and some timeout values can be configured here. Please see the inline comments in the file on how to change settings.
