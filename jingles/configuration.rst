Jingles Configuration
*********************

The Jingles configuration file is stored in ``/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js`` it's a JSON file with configuration values. It is copied during the first installation and does not get overwritten, however the newest configuration can always be found under ``/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js.example``

In this config file you can set the remote dataset server source and set thresholds for dashboard alerts and timeout values. Please see the inline comments within the file on how to make setting changes.
